# Basic-Image-Processing-Using-Matlab
<p> This repository contains basic image processing matlab code files, which I have practiced during my " Digital Image Processing using Matlab " Semester Course.
I have added all my assignments and lab practice files. Appologizes for the mess. I have not organised them properly. You can download entire repository and look for the code you need. I am writing down a few topics for which you can look into repo though few matlab code file names are a bit descriptive too. </p>
<br/>

<ul> The topics are: 
  <li> How to read image and video file in matlab. </li>
  <li> Bit Plane Slicing using Matlab.</li>
<li>Image Filtering using Matlab. Low Pass Filtering, Canny Filter, Prewitt, Sobel and Robert Filters. Median Filter.</li>
<li>Power Transformation Law in Matlab.</li>
<li>Negative of an Image in Matlab.</li>
  <li>Log Transformation Law in Matlab.</li>
<li>Contrast Stretching in Matlab.</li>
  <li>Image boundary Detection in Matlab.</li>
<li>Image Dilation, and Erosion in Matlab.</li>
  
  </ul>
