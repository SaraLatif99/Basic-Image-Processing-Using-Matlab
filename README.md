# Basic-Image-Processing-Using-Matlab
This repository contains basic image processing matlab code files, which I have practiced during my " Digital Image Processing using Matlab " Semester Course.
I have added all my assignments and lab practice files. Appologizes for the mess. I have not organised them properly. You can download entire repository and look for the code you need. I am writing down a few topics for which you can look into repo though few matlab code file names are a bit descriptive too. The topics are
How to read image and video file in matlab>
Bit Plane Slicing using Matlab.
Image Filtering using Matlab. Low Pass Filtering, Canny Filter, Prewitt, Sobel and Robert Filters. Median Filter.
Power Transformation Law in Matlab.
Negative of an Image in Matlab.
Log Transformation Law in Matlab.
Contrast Stretching in Matlab.
Image boundary Detection in Matlab.
